I am deeply immersed in the field of mathematics. My journey has been a confluence of dedication and passion, shaping a path through rigorous academic pursuits. Currently undertaking a Masterâ€™s degree in Modeling and Numerical Analysis at the University of Montpellier, I hold a rich foundation bolstered by another Master's degree specialized in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and their applications..
My academic focus lies predominantly in the theoretical and numerical analysis of partial differential equations, applying these concepts extensively to problems rooted in physics, particularly in fluid mechanics. This rigorous academic background has armed me with substantial mathematical prowess, which I am keen to leverage in industrial settings. I am driven by a profound interest in harnessing my mathematical expertise to unravel complex problems and innovate practical solutions in various industrial domains.
