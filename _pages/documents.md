The objective of our work is to present, among these results, those of Peng  who studied the asymptotic behavior of the endemic equilibrium when the rate of susceptibles or that of the infected tends towards infinity or zero. This study consists of four chapters. In Chapter 1, we provide mathematical reminders necessary for the demonstration of Theorems 1 and 2 of Chapter four, such as the maximum principle, Hopf's theorem, and some tools from Sobolev spaces."
"In Chapter 2, we present the S.I.S model governing the densities S and I of the susceptible and infected individuals respectively, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solution to the S.I.S model.
Chapter 3 deals with the equilibrium state of the S.I.S model, specifically the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium.
The final chapter aims to study the asymptotic behaviors of the endemic equilibrium. It is based on two main theorems for which we provide their proofs and their epidemiological interpretation. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-2Emq7GrrguIsBMrSZwNKQDac_lZaq5k">mémoire</a>

Implementation of Second Order Finite Volume Methods and Slope Limiters 
======
In the first chapter titled "Scalar Equations," we studied linear equations and non-linear equations, addressing the non-uniqueness of weak solutions and the Riemann problem.
In the second chapter, "Finite Volume Schemes for Scalar Conservation Laws," we explored the principle of the Finite Volume Method, discussing first and second order schemes, and presented some results related to these methods. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4vhXYbVRDBODrrxe0R5XY__dXJBecpp">Rapport Stage</a>
